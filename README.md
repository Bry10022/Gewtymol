# Gewtymol
Gewtymol is an Open Source Font that I have created.

The .sfd file is available if anyone wants to make changes.

# How to install fonts on Windows
## Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7 or Windows Vista
- Right-click on the font and choose Install. Or, you can open the font in the default Windows font viewer and click the Install button

## Windows XP
- Go to Start > Control Panel
- Open the Fonts folder
- Browse for the font you want to install (you extracted this from the zip file earlier)
- Click OK

## All Windows versions
- Drag and drop (or copy and paste) the font file to the folder C:\Windows\Fonts

If you want to temporarily install a font, just Double-click the font file and you can use it in your applications (Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop, etc.) while it is left open. To uninstall the font, close the Font Viewer. Please not that this may not be true depending on the version of Windows you have installed
